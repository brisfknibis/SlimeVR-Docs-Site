This is the fastest path from "I just opened the box" to "I'm walking around in VR with full-body tracking." Each step has a dedicated page for more detail — links are inline.

If you've never used SlimeVR before, it's worth skimming [How the Trackers Work](/getting-started/how-trackers-work/) first. Otherwise, go.

## 1. Charge the trackers

Drop each tracker into the included **charging dock** with the USB-C port facing down, then plug the dock into a **wall charger**, not a PC port — wall charging is faster.

Trackers usually arrive mostly charged, but let them all reach full once before you start. See [Charging](/charging-and-battery/charging/) for details.

## 2. Install the SlimeVR Server

On your PC (the same one you'll run VR from), download and install the **SlimeVR Server** from [slimevr.dev](https://slimevr.dev). It's a free open-source app. Full install notes: [Install SlimeVR Server](/slimevr-server/install/).

After install, launch it. You'll see the SlimeVR window with a list of trackers (empty for now).

## 3. Plug in the receiver

Take the **USB receiver dongle** and the **USB extension cable** from your kit. Plug the receiver into the extension cable, then the extension into your PC. **Don't plug the receiver directly into the back of your PC** — extending it up and away from your computer dramatically improves wireless range.

Mount or rest the receiver as high as you can in your playspace, ideally above head height with a clear line of sight to where you'll be tracking. More: [Receiver Placement](/receiver/range-and-placement/).

## 4. Power on the trackers

Pick up each tracker and **press the button once**. The LED will come on; the tracker is now broadcasting. Each tracker is **pre-paired to your receiver**, so as soon as the server sees it, it'll appear in the SlimeVR window.

If a tracker doesn't show up after 10 seconds, see [Pairing](/trackers/pairing/) and [Tracker Won't Pair](/troubleshooting/tracker-not-pairing/).

## 5. Strap up

Attach each tracker to its strap (the tracker slides into the silicone tray, USB port down). Mount them in roughly the right places — the exact positions are shown in [Wearing Trackers](/straps/wearing-trackers/) — and tighten the straps until they're snug but not painful.

Don't worry about precision yet. The server's mounting calibration will figure out orientation in a few seconds.

## 6. Run the first-launch wizard

Back in the SlimeVR Server window, click **Setup**. The wizard will walk you through:

1. Wi-Fi credentials — **skip this** for IBIS trackers (they use the receiver, not Wi-Fi)
2. **Assign each tracker to a body part** (left foot, right ankle, hip, etc.)
3. **Mounting calibration** — strike a T-pose and follow the prompts
4. **Body proportions** — enter your height, then either let AutoBone measure you in VR or fine-tune by hand

Full walkthrough: [First Launch](/slimevr-server/first-launch/).

## 7. Enter VR

With the SlimeVR window still running:

- **PCVR** (Index, Quest Link, Vive, Pimax, etc.) — start SteamVR. SlimeVR's SteamVR driver picks up the trackers automatically.
- **Quest standalone / standalone Pico** — see [SteamVR & OSC](/slimevr-server/steamvr-and-osc/).

Put your headset on, stand straight, and press your **full reset** keybind (default: trigger a reset from the SlimeVR window). You're tracked.

## 8. Set up reset bindings

Drift over time is normal. Bind the **full reset** and **yaw reset** to controller buttons so you can re-zero from VR without taking the headset off. See [Resets](/slimevr-server/resets/).

## You're done

If something doesn't work, jump to [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/). If it does — welcome to full-body VR.
