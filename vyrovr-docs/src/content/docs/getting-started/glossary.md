## SlimeVR

The open-source project whose software (the SlimeVR Server) drives all SlimeVR-compatible trackers, IBIS included. Maintained at [slimevr.dev](https://slimevr.dev).

## SlimeVR Server

The desktop app on your PC that talks to your trackers via the USB receiver, manages body configuration, and feeds data into SteamVR or VRChat OSC.

## SlimeVR GUI

The web-style interface that opens when you launch the SlimeVR Server. Where you do all setup and configuration.

## IBIS tracker

A VYRO-VR-made, SlimeVR-compatible tracker using the nRF 2.4 GHz wireless protocol. Sometimes called a "Smol Slime" or "stacked Smol Slime" in community contexts.

## NRF / Smol Slime

Community names for tracker designs built on Nordic nRF52 chips. IBIS trackers are part of this family.

## Receiver / dongle

The small USB stick that listens for tracker radio traffic and relays it to the SlimeVR Server. Required for IBIS trackers.

## IMU

Inertial Measurement Unit — the motion sensor inside each tracker (IBIS uses the LSM6DSV). Measures rotation rate and acceleration.

## Mounting

Which physical orientation the tracker is in when worn (face up, face down, USB-port toward foot, etc.). Mounting calibration figures this out automatically so you don't have to.

## Mounting calibration

A short routine in the SlimeVR setup wizard where you stand and pose in specific ways so the server can figure out each tracker's mounting.

## Body proportions

The lengths of your bones (femur, tibia, torso, etc.). SlimeVR needs these to translate tracker rotations into limb positions.

## AutoBone

The SlimeVR feature that measures your body proportions automatically by watching you walk and squat in VR. Usually beats manual entry.

## Full reset

Re-zeros all tracker rotations to your current pose. Use when drift has built up. Stand straight, face forward, trigger.

## Yaw reset

Re-zeros only horizontal (left/right facing) drift. Faster and less invasive than a full reset; safe to trigger often.

## Mounting reset

Re-runs mounting calibration on the fly. Use if a tracker shifted on your body or you put it on the wrong way around.

## Stay Aligned

A SlimeVR Server 0.16+ feature that automatically corrects yaw drift while you play, reducing how often you need yaw resets.

## DFU mode

"Device Firmware Update" mode. A special boot state on the tracker for re-flashing firmware. Triggered by 4-5 button presses — don't do this unless you're updating firmware.

## OSC

Open Sound Control — the message protocol VRChat (and some other apps) use to receive tracker data on standalone headsets like Quest.

## SteamVR driver

The piece of software that exposes SlimeVR trackers to SteamVR as virtual Vive-style trackers. Installed automatically by the SlimeVR Server.

## Feeder app

A separate utility that forwards data from another tracking system (like a Vive lighthouse setup) into SlimeVR for hybrid use. Not needed for IBIS-only setups.
