title: Installing the Receiver

The receiver is the small USB stick that talks to your trackers. It's the only piece of hardware besides the trackers that has to be connected to your PC.

## Step by step

1. **Plug the receiver into the USB extension cable**, not directly into your PC.
2. **Plug the other end of the extension cable** into a free USB port on your PC. Any USB-A port works; USB 2.0 is fine.
3. **Place the receiver up and away** from your computer — clipped to a shelf, taped to the back of a monitor, hanging from a desk lamp, whatever works. Higher = better. See [Range & Placement](/receiver/range-and-placement/) for why this matters.
4. **Plug in a tracker** (single button press to power on). It should appear in the SlimeVR Server window within a few seconds.

That's it. No drivers, no pairing app, no Wi-Fi credentials. The receiver is HID-class and Windows / macOS / Linux all recognize it without setup.

## How do I know it's recognized?

- On Windows, Device Manager will show a HID-compliant device appearing when you plug the receiver in.
- In the SlimeVR Server window, any powered-on paired tracker will show up. If the SlimeVR Server window shows zero trackers and you know your trackers are charged, the receiver is the likely suspect — see [Receiver Not Detected](/troubleshooting/receiver-not-detected/).

## Do not

- Plug the receiver directly into the back of a tower PC. The metal chassis kills 2.4 GHz range — that's literally what the extension is for.
- Plug it into a USB 3.0 hub near your headset cable. USB 3 emits 2.4 GHz noise; co-locating the receiver with USB-3 traffic causes dropouts.
- Bend the receiver's body. The internal antenna is short — let the extension cable do the routing.

## Multiple receivers

Each receiver works as a single, self-contained pairing group. You can run two receivers (e.g., one VYRO kit + one borrowed setup) on the same PC if you really want to, but trackers paired to receiver A will not appear via receiver B. For everyday use, one receiver per playspace is the answer.
